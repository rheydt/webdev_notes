Images
- eliminate necessary img resources on mobile
- minify images w/ imagemin
- use CSS3 effects when possible
- use vector graphics (SVG) when possible (logos, geometric shapes)
	- SVG is an XML-based img format
	- compress SVG files w/ GZIP
- load different resolution raster images for different viewports
	- file types: PNG, JPEG, GIF
	- new types: JPEG-XR, WebP

Fonts
- 4 factors that affect performance:
	-  # of fonts and font-weights/styles on a page
	- total byte size of fonts used on a page
	- transfer latency of the font resource
	- time when the font downloads are initiated
- use web fonts, and limit # of fonts
- never encode text in an image
- to reduce transfer latency:
	- font subsetting
	- UA-specific optimization
	- more efficient compression
	- ideally, font resources are cached
- Resource Timing API: allows us to get the DNS, TCP, and transfer time data for each font
- Google Fonts is very useful
- time out slow downloads (how this works depends on the browser)
- optimize when the fetch is initiated for the font
