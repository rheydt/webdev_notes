Reverse a string using pure Javascript.




How do you detect for the first repeated character in a string?

	Loop through the characters in the string, comparing each to the one following it
	Save the first character in the string, save the second character, compare the 2


	for (i = 0; i < (myString.length - 1); i++) {

		var x = myString.substr(i, i+);
		var y = myString.substr(i+1, i+2);

		if (x == y) {
			return x + y;
		}

	}


How do you detect whether or not a word is a palindrome?

	Get the length of the string
	Divide the length by 2
	Round the product down
	Get a substring of the first half (rounded down) of the string, save in a var
	Get a substring of the second half (rounded down) of the string, save in a var
	Split the string into array items, reverse the array, rejoin into a string
	Check if the two vars are equal in value

	var midpoint = ((myString.length)/2).floor;
	var firstHalf = myString.substr(0,midpoint-1);
	var secondHalf = myString.substr(midpoint, myString.length);
	var reversedHalf = secondHalf.split("").reverse().join("");

	if (firstHalf == reversedHalf) {
		return true;
	}
	else {
		return false;
	}

	myString = "1 2 3 4 3 2 1";
	var midpoint = ((myString.length)/2).floor; // (7/2).floor = (3.5).floor = 3
	var firstHalf = myString.substr(0,midpoint-1); // 1 2 3
	var secondHalf = myString.substr(midpoint, myString.length); // 3 2 1
